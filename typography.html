   <h1>How to NOT burn popcorn</h1>
   <p class="text1">To avoid burning popcorn, you can:
Use a heavy-bottomed pot
Cheap pots don't distribute heat evenly, which can lead to hot spots that burn the popcorn.

Adjust the heat
After the first pops, turn the heat down to medium or medium-low so the kernels have time to pop without burning.

Shake the pot
Shake the pot every minute or so to ensure all the kernels get a chance to pop.

Use a dry pan
You can pop popcorn in a dry pan or skillet without oil.

Test the temperature
Start with two kernels to test the temperature. Once they pop, the oil is hot enough.</p>
<p class="p1">Add a lid slightly
While the popcorn is popping, you can slightly tip the lid to allow steam to escape and prevent the popcorn from
steaming itself in the pot.

Season immediately
Season the popcorn right away so the heat helps the seasoning stick.

Use clarified butter
Regular butter has a lower smoke point than the temperature needed for popcorn to pop, so it can burn before the popcorn
is done.

If you're microwaving popcorn, you can use a separate plate to reduce heat stress on the microwave's glass plate.</p>
